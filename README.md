# Magic Deck Utils
A couple of bash scripts I used to build my magic deck.
My computer lags when I use moxfield lol.
Tappedout.net has a really bad compare funtion.

## Scripts
* difference.sh takes two decks and shows which cards are unique to the first
* sanitize.sh removes the print information and standardizes the input
